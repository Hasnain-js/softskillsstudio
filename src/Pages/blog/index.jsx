            According to our research no such programs are being organized to
            work on soft skills of students living in orphanages. Few orphanages
            itself are working on those skills but mostly are not. So we have
            decided to search only those orphanages where these types of program
            were not held. Secondly we will not be teaching them through long
            speeches but we will organize ew activities to teach them. They will
            themselves learn these skills with their interests. This is our
            unique value proposition. We will create that environment for them
            where they will take interest to learn these soft skills.

            After a researched, the problem area we find is, in orphanage
            students are highly unconfident and lack basics soft skills like
            (confidence, critical thinking team work etc). They don’t feel
            connected in that environment at most places. So, we decided to
            visit such orphanages and develop these soft skills among students
            of orphanage through arranging few activities and motivational
            talks. According to is every child has power to do big things and
            they can bring change in the societies, just a little motivation is
            needed. We will target all those orphanages where these skills are
            not being provided. Also, we have decided to arrange these
            activities among primary level because these are the students who
            are least motivated and shy. We have created a curriculum and
            decided the activities related to each soft skill which we are going
            to arrange in the orphanages. Orphanages to which we have to visit
            are still in research process. We will target three orphanages at
            most and will pay visit on weekly basis.
            <br /> Here is our timeline:
            <br />
            <br /> Week 1: Researched for problem
            <br /> Week 2: created curriculum and decided activities
            <br />
            Week 3: contact to organizations
            <br />
            Week 4-6: visiting different orphanages

            Students in orphanages are provided with basics education and
            technical skills but still lack in soft skills. In these

            them in many ways. So our idea is to teach them these soft skills
            and their importance through different activities. We will teach
            them in a very fun way by arranging some games and interesting
            activities.

            We searched through google and took opinions/ideas of different
            people by creating google forms and posting on our social media
            platforms. Through ideas of different people which they shared with
            us we reached to the problem that students in orphanages lack some
            basics soft skills. They are too shy to talk and in making new
            friends. There are no such programs for developing these soft skills
            in students of orphanages. Few orphans are there who work on these
            skills of students but mostly don’t. So, we decided to target all
            those orphanages where students are not being provided with these
            soft skills. The basics key learning from this research process was,
            organizations work on technical skills of students but few are there
            who value teaching soft skills. Although these are the skills which
            every human should possess in order to succeed. In orphanages
            students share difficult past which have demotivated them in many
            ways. They become unconfident. Every student is intelligent and
            brilliant mind. Developing these skills in students of orphanages
            will not only help them in professional life but also in personal
            life.
